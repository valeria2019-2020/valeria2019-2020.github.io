         <h1>About me</h1>
        <p> Hey!!!! my name is Valeria Ruiz i am from Oakland California. 
            My mom is from Tepic Nayarit, and my dad is from Michoac&aacute;n.
            I have been living in Oakland my whole life and my little brother 
            is also from Oakland. My other older siblings were born in Galax 
            Virginia but moved here when my mom was pregnant with me. It would 
            have been cool if I was born in Virginia. Things i really like to do 
            in my free time is listening to music, i really like to sleep,
            re-watch That 70's Show on netflix, and spending time with my mommy,
            or sometimes practicing volleyball. </p>
